# Example FS Map Feature Repository
This repository contains the proposed code changes for the Fresno State Map page. 

## Purpose
These code changes should allow one to manipulate the existing map page, so as to show a desired campus building upon the first visit to the page (without needing to use the building selection tool); all through the use of an appended anchor ID ("#example-id").

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ This proposal only expands  functionality that exists *currently* for the University Center. To see this working, visit https://www.fresnostate.edu/map/#universitycenter

## Example Scenario
For instance, the V.E. Petrucci Library would like to include a link to the campus map page, which would automatically show their building, rather than display a map graphic file or force a visitor to multiple steps in order to find their campus location.

## Working Example
The working code example can be found at: http://www.lib.csufresno.edu/test/map/#ve-petrucci
